<h1>The best series according to Oscar</h1>
<h2>My top 3 series of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>How I Met Your Mother</h3>
<p>Smartest humor I've ever watched, comedy with a message.</p>
<h3>Lie to me</h3>
<p>This series motivated me to learn about body language.<br /> I regretted it later on.</p>
<h3>Friends</h3>
<p>Watched it 3 times, nothing else to say.</p>
